As for our project, we used ES algorithm to tackle with obstacle avoidance task. There is no trained model.
But we can consider the result of best motor speed pair to choose as trained/model. They are as follow:

at start
Generation 1:
Maximum Score: 483
Best Individual Motor Speeds:
Fast Turn Speed: 0.72 rad/s
Left Turn Speed: 0.23 rad/s
Right Turn Speed: -0.52 rad/s
-----------------------------
Generation 10:
Maximum Score: 574
Best Individual Motor Speeds:
Fast Turn Speed: 1.01 rad/s
Left Turn Speed: 0.51 rad/s
Right Turn Speed: -0.58 rad/s
Score history for all generations are [483, 474, 542, 528, 562, 565, 528, 554, 583, 574]


The result can also be easily find at the presentation demo video and report.
